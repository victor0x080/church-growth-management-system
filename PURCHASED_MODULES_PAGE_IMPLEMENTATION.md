# Purchased Modules Page Implementation

## Summary

Created a dedicated page for viewing and managing purchased bundles, modules, and agents with unsubscribe functionality. Updated both dashboards to show a summary card linking to this page.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Page: `PurchasedModulesPage.tsx`

A comprehensive page for managing purchased items:

#### **Features:**
- **Bundles Display**: Shows all purchased bundles with included modules
- **Individual Modules Display**: Shows modules purchased outside of bundles
- **AI Agents Display**: Shows all configured AI agents
- **Unsubscribe Functionality**: 
  - Unsubscribe from bundles (removes entire bundle)
  - Unsubscribe from individual modules (also removes associated agents)
  - Unsubscribe from individual agents
- **Summary Statistics**: Shows total bundles, modules, and agents
- **Empty State**: Shows when no modules are purchased

#### **Unsubscribe Mechanisms:**

1. **Bundle Unsubscribe**:
   ```typescript
   - Deletes from `church_bundles` table
   - Toast notification on success
   - Reloads data to refresh view
   ```

2. **Module Unsubscribe**:
   ```typescript
   - Deletes from `church_modules` table
   - Also deletes all agents associated with that module
   - Toast notification on success
   - Reloads data to refresh view
   ```

3. **Agent Unsubscribe**:
   ```typescript
   - Deletes from `church_agents` table
   - Toast notification on success
   - Reloads data to refresh view
   ```

### 2. Updated Dashboards

#### **Clergy Dashboard**
- Removed detailed bundles/modules/agents display
- Added summary card with statistics
- Button: "View Purchased Modules" → Navigate to `/clergy/purchased-modules`

#### **Parish Dashboard**
- Removed detailed bundles/modules display
- Added summary card with statistics
- Button: "View My Modules" → Navigate to `/purchased-modules`

### 3. Dashboard Summary Cards

Both dashboards now show:
- **Bundle Count**: Number of purchased bundles
- **Module Count**: Number of individual modules
- **Agent Count**: Number of active AI agents
- **Button**: Navigate to detailed management page

### 4. Routes Added

```typescript
/purchased-modules          // Parish users
/clergy/purchased-modules   // Clergy users
```

## User Flow

1. **Dashboard View**: User sees summary statistics
2. **Click Button**: "View Purchased Modules" or "View My Modules"
3. **Detailed Page**: Shows all bundles, modules, and agents
4. **Unsubscribe**: Click unsubscribe button on any item
5. **Confirmation**: Toast notification appears
6. **Reload**: Page refreshes to show updated list

## Database Operations

### When Unsubscribing from Bundle:
```sql
DELETE FROM church_bundles 
WHERE church_id = ? AND bundle_id = ?
```

### When Unsubscribing from Module:
```sql
DELETE FROM church_modules 
WHERE id = ?

DELETE FROM church_agents 
WHERE church_id = ? AND module_name = ?
```

### When Unsubscribing from Agent:
```sql
DELETE FROM church_agents 
WHERE id = ?
```

## Design Features

### PurchasedModulesPage UI:
- **Header**: Back button, title, and statistics summary
- **Bundle Section**: 
  - Purple gradient theme
  - Shows bundle name, description, price
  - Lists included modules as badges
  - Unsubscribe button with trash icon
  
- **Modules Section**:
  - Grid layout
  - Shows module name and price
  - Active badge
  - Unsubscribe button

  - Unsubscribe button
  
- **Empty State**:

## Benefits

1. **Clean Dashboards**: No clutter, just summary statistics
2. **Dedicated Management**: Separate page for detailed management
3. **Unsubscribe Control**: Users can remove items they don't need
4. **Data Integrity**: Proper cascade deletion of related items
5. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded sections (Purple, Blue, Green)
6. **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
7. **Toast Notifications**: User feedback on actions

## Security

- Protected routes using `<ProtectedRoute>`

- RLS policies apply (from migration)
- User can only manage their own church's modules
