# Dashboard Modules & Bundles Display Implementation

## Summary

Both the **Clergy Dashboard** and **Parish Dashboard** now display purchased bundles, modules, and agents from the database, showing what features are currently active for the church.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Queries

The dashboard now fetches three types of data:

- **Bundles**: Queries `church_bundles` table to get bundle IDs, then fetches full bundle details from `bundles` table and their associated modules from `bundle_modules` table
- **Modules**: Queries `church_modules` table for all individual modules purchased
- **Agents**: Queries `church_agents` table for all AI agents configured for the church

### 2. Visual Display

Three new card sections appear on both dashboards:

#### **Purchased Bundles** (Purple Theme)
- Shows all bundles purchased by the church
- Displays bundle name, description, price, and all modules included in each bundle
- Each bundle shows as a card with expandable module list
- Modules are displayed as badges

#### **Purchased Modules** (Blue Theme)
- Shows all individual modules activated
- Grid layout showing module name and price
- Icons to distinguish modules

#### **Active Agents** (Green Theme)
- Shows all AI agents configured across modules
- Grid layout showing agent name and the module it belongs to
- Bot icon to indicate AI functionality

### 3. When They Appear

- **Bundles section**: Only appears if `purchasedBundles.length > 0`
- **Modules section**: Only appears if `purchasedModules.length > 0`
- **Agents section**: Only appears if `purchasedAgents.length > 0`

This keeps the dashboard clean if no modules/bundles have been purchased yet.

## How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **On Login**: User profile is loaded with `church_id`
2. **Query Execution**: 
   - Load bundles from `church_bundles` WHERE `church_id` = X
   - For each bundle, fetch details from `bundles` and modules from `bundle_modules`
   - Load individual modules from `church_modules`
   - Load agents from `church_agents`
3. **State Management**: Data is stored in React state:
   - `purchasedBundles` - Array of bundle objects with modules
   - `purchasedModules` - Array of module objects
   - `purchasedAgents` - Array of agent objects
4. **Rendering**: Each section conditionally renders if data exists

### Code Structure

```typescript
// State variables
const [purchasedBundles, setPurchasedBundles] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [purchasedModules, setPurchasedModules] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [purchasedAgents, setPurchasedAgents] = useState<any[]>([]);

// Fetch function
const loadPurchasedData = async (churchId: string) => {
  // 1. Get bundle IDs for church
  // 2. Fetch bundle details
  // 3. Fetch bundle modules
  // 4. Combine into bundle objects
  // 5. Fetch individual modules
  // 6. Fetch agents
  // 7. Update state
};

// Render in JSX
{purchasedBundles.length > 0 && (
  <Card>
    {/* Bundle display */}
  </Card>
)}
```

## Design Features

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Color-coded sections (Purple for bundles, Blue for modules, Green for agents)
- **Badges**: Module names displayed as badges for easy scanning
- **Icons**: Package icon for bundles, Layers icon for modules, Bot icon for agents
- **Responsive**: Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only shows if data exists
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive cards with hover states

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Church leadership can see exactly what they've purchased
2. **Module Visibility**: Easy to see which modules are included in bundles vs purchased individually
3. **Agent Tracking**: See all AI agents active in the system
4. **Onboarding Continuity**: Users see what was selected during onboarding
5. **Cost Visibility**: Pricing displayed for transparency
6. **Dual Dashboard Support**: Both Clergy and Parish dashboards show purchased modules/bundles
7. **User Awareness**: Regular users can see what features are available to them

## Next Steps (Optional)

- Add module status indicators (Active, Inactive, Pending)
- Add click-to-configure functionality for modules
- Show usage statistics per module
- Add "Upgrade" suggestions based on usage
- Integrate with billing/invoicing system
- Add search/filter for modules and agents
